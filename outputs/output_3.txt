She opened the door and saw a young man sitting on a bench. He was wearing a white robe, a black leather jacket and light blue jeans. He was short, light-skinned, with a large, dark beard. His hair was black and yellow with a light blue stripe on his middle. The boy was wearing a white shirt and dark pants. It was not clear to him who was carrying out the attackâ€”the assailant was not yet dressed.

He took a short, wide step towards the police. The man in the white robe, dressed in a white suit, gave him a large, red dagger. He placed it on his head and took a deep breath. He then gave the knife to the suspect. A police officer then arrived and took the knife; the knife was not in the hands of the suspect. The police officer placed a red cloth bag on the defendant's head and carried it in a box in his hands. The defendant was taken to a hospital where he was examined by a doctor, who confirmed his condition. He was then transported to the hospital. On the morning of the attack, the victim was rushed to the hospital.

The defendant was taken to a hospital and admitted to the hospital where he was immediately transferred to the Children's Hospital of the Hospital for Children
